GSB 553

### Instructor
Ajin Joseph (ajin@iittp.ac.in)


### Announcements
**13/01/2019: Lecture notes uploaded.**

**17/01/2019: Assignment 1 is available online. See schedule section. **

### Office hours

### Course Objective
The course objective is to study the analysis of stochastic approximation algorithms from the viewpoint of dynamical systems.

### Prerequisites

We will cover the needed background, from the beginning (probability, stochastic processes). The goal of the courses is to introduce reinforcement learning.

### Textbooks
Stochastic Approximation: A Dynamical Systems Viewpoint, Vivek S. Borkar.

**Recommended supplements**

Stochastic Approximation and Recursive Algorithms and Applications. George Yin and Harold J. Kushner
